    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>One of the features of the framework is the ability to run it as a command line application using terminals. This can be usefull if the server that the application is deployed in have SSH access. The command line interface of the framework has a limit functionality but the developer can extend it by creating custom commands.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After completing the next set of tutorials, the developer should be able to use the framework using CLI. Also, he should be able to create his own custom commands and run them.</p>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Depending on the operating system that will be in use, the run way may differ. But there is one thing which is common. The first thing is that we must know where PHP interpeter is installed. After that, we run it as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>PATH_TO_PHP webfiori</code></pre>
    <p>Let's assume that PHP interpeter is installed on Linux. If the framework is downloaded and all standard libraries of the framework are also included, the following output would be seen when running the command <code>php webfiori</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori                                                                                                                       
    |\                /|

    WebFiori Framework (c) Version 1.1.0 CR-5

    Usage:
        command [arg1 arg2="val" arg3...]

    Available Commands:
        help
            Display CLI Help. To display help for specific command, use the argument "--command-name" with this command.
        v
            Display framework version info.
        show-config
            Display framework configuration.
        list-themes
            List all registered themes.
        list-jobs
            List all scheduled CRON jobs.
        list-routes
            List all created routes and which resource they point to.
        cron
                   Run CRON Scheduler
        route
            Test the result of routing to a URL</code></pre>
    <p>Once this output appears, it means everything is ready to use the framework in CLI environment.</p>
    <h2>Running Commands</h2>
    <p>In order to run a command, we have to understand the structure of each command.</p>
    <p>The overall format of any command in the framework is this: <code>command-name [arg1 arg2="something" arg3...]</code>. This format means that every command in the framework consist of the following parts:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Command name (the <code>command-name</code> part).</li>
    <li>Zero or more arguments (the <code>[arg1 arg2="something" arg3...]</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The name of the command is usually something like <code>help</code> or <code>h</code>. The arguments usually come after the name of the command. Some commands does not have arguments and some do. In addition, a command can have optional arguments and mandatory ones.</p>
    <p>One of the commands that the framework supports is the command <code>help</code>. When we run it without any arguments, we would see the following output:</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori help                                                                                                           
    Usage:
        command [arg1 arg2="val" arg3...]

    Available Commands:
        help
            Display CLI Help. To display help for specific command, use the argument "--command-name" with this command.
        v
            Display framework version info.
        show-config
            Display framework configuration.
        list-themes
            List all registered themes.
        list-jobs
            List all scheduled CRON jobs.
        list-routes
            List all created routes and which resource they point to.
        cron
                   Run CRON Scheduler
        route
            Test the result of routing to a URL</code></pre>
    <p>From the help, we can notice that the help supports one argument and the name of the argument is <code>--command-name</code>. This argument is used to show help for a specific command. For example, if we want to show the help for the command <code>cron</code>, we can do it as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori help --command-name=cron                
        cron
                   Run CRON Scheduler
        Supported Arguments:
                                p:  CRON password.
                            check: [Optional] Run a check aginst all jobs to check if it is time to execute them or not.
                            force: [Optional] Force a specific job to execute.
                         job-name: [Optional] The name of the job that will be forced to execute.
                    show-job-args: [Optional] If this one is provided with job name and a job has custom execution args, they will be shown.
                         show-log: [Optional] If set, execution log will be shown after execution is completed.</code></pre>
    <h2>Implementing CLI Commands</h2>
    <p>One of the features of the framework is that it allows the developers to extend the functionality which is provided by CLI engine of the framework by creating their own custom commands. Creating new one is very simple. It involves the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Creating new PHP class that extends the class <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand"><code>CLICommand</code></a></li>
    <li>Implementing the abstract method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#exec"><code>CLICommand::exec()</code></a>.</li>
    <li>Register the command using the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLI#register"><code>CLI::register()</code></a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The last setp must be performed if the command class is created outside the folder <code>app/commands</code>. If the command is created inside that folder, it will be auto-registered. What we will do next is to create a very basic command which will only show output message that says "hi".</p>
    <h3>Extending The Class "CLICommand"</h3>
    <p>The first step in creating new command is to create new PHP class and make the class a child of the class <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand"><code>CLICommand</code></a>. If we checked the constructor of the class, it takes 3 parameters. The first one is the name of the command, the second one is an array of arguments and the last one is a description of the command. </p>
    <p>The name of the command is a string which will be used to call it from the terminal. The arguments is an array that contains sub associative arrays of arguments that the command needs. The description of the command is a string that will be shown when the command <code>help</code> is executed.</p>
    <p>Suppose that we would like to implement a command that takes the name from the terminal as an input and display the string "Hi ". Let's assume that the name of the command is <code>say-hi</code>. The command that will be created will be in the folder <code>app/commands</code>. The following code snippit shows how this command is created.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">

    namespace webfiori\entity\cli;

    use webfiori\entity\cli\CLICommand;

    class SayHiCommand extends CLICommand {

        public function __construct() {
            parent::__construct('say-hi', [], 'Takes a name as input and say "Hi".');
        }

        public function exec() {
            $name = $this->getInput('Give me your name:');
            $this->println("Hi $name");
            return 0;
        }

    }
    // We have to do this step if the command belongs to a namespace. 
    return __NAMESPACE__
    </code></pre>
    <p>Before we continue, let's explain what we did. The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#getInput"><code>CLICommand::getInput()</code></a> is used to read user input from <code>STDIN</code>. The method accepts 3 parameters but for now, we will only use the first one. The first parameter of the method is simply a prompt text that will be shown to the user. The text is used to specify what we would like to get from the user.</p>
    <p>The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#println"><code>CLICommand::println()</code></a> is used to show output. It will send it directly to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>
    <h3>Registering the command</h3>
    <p>If the command is created inside the folder <code>app/commands</code>, it will be registered automatically. But if the command is created somewhere else, it must be registered manually. To register any custom-created command, the class <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/ini/InitCliCommands"><code>InitCliCommands</code></a> can be used to complete this task. The class has one static method at which the developer can modify its body. The following code shows how to register new command.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">namespace webfiori\ini;

    use webfiori\entity\cli\CLI;

    //first, import the command.
    use webfiori\entity\cli\SayHiCommand;

    class InitCliCommands {

        public static function init() {
            //After importing, register it.
            CLI::register(new SayHiCommand());
        }
    }</code></pre>
    <h3>Running The Command</h3>
    <p>When the command <code>help</code> is executed, the newly created command will appear at the end of supported commands list as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>say-hi
            Takes a name as input and say "Hi".</code></pre>
    <p>When the command is executed, the output in the terminal will be similar to the one shown in next snippit.</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori say-hi
    Give me your name:
    Ibrahim BinAlshikh
    Hi Ibrahim BinAlshikh</code></pre>
    <h2>Using Command Line Arguments</h2>
    <p>Usually, a command can have some arguments which are passed to it when it is called. Some arguments can be optional and some are not. In addition to that, some arguments might work as an options. If added, they will make the command behave in different way.</p>
    <p>Adding support for arguments to a command can be achived in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Supply the arguments to the constructor of the class <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#__construct"><code>CLICommand</code></a>.</li>
    <li>Using the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#addArgs"><code>CLICommand::addArgs()</code></a> to add multiple args at once.</li>
    <li>Using the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#addArg"><code>CLICommand::addArg()</code></a> to add one argument.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What we will do is to use the constructor of the class to add arguments to the command which we created in last lessen. We will add two arguments, <code>--name</code> and <code>--email</code>. If the name is not provided, we will simply read it when the job starts to execute.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">

    namespace webfiori\entity\cli;

    use webfiori\entity\cli\CLICommand;

    class SayHiCommand extends CLICommand{

        public function __construct() {
            parent::__construct('say-hi', [
                '--name' => [
                    'optional' => true
                ],
                '--email' => [
                    'optional' => true
                ]
            ], 'Takes a name as input and say "Hi".');
        }

        public function exec() {
            $name = $this->getArgValue('--name');

            if ($name === null) {
                $name = $this->getInput('Give me your name:');
            }
            $email = $this->getArgValue('--email');
            $this->println("Hi $name");

            if ($email === null) {
                $this->warning('Email is not provided.');
            } else {
                $this->println("Email address: $email");
            }
            return 0;
        }
    }</code></pre>
    <p>Now that we have our command, we can run it. There are 3 possibilites, one is that we have everything as arguments, the second is we have only the <code>--name</code> argument and the last is to have none. The next output will be shown when running the command with all arguments.</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori say-hi --name="Ibrahim" --email="example@mydomain.com"
    Hi Ibrahim
    Email address: example@mydomain.com</code></pre>
    <p>The next output will be shown when running the command with the argument <code>--name</code> is set and the argument <code>--email</code> is missing.</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori say-hi --name="Ibrahim"                                                                         
    Hi Ibrahim
    Warning: Email is not provided.</code></pre>
    <p>You can notice the statement which was shown by the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#warning"><code>CLICommand::warning()</code></a>. It is one of the methods which is used to format the output.</p>
    <p>The next output will be shown when running the command without providing any arguments.</p>
    <pre><code>$ php webfiori say-hi                                                                                          
    Give me your name:
    Ibrahim Ali
    Hi Ibrahim Ali
    Warning: Email is not provided.</code></pre>
    <h2>Reading User Input</h2>
    <p>We have seen how to get user input from the terminal using the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#getInput"><code>CLICommand::getInput()</code></a> when we implemented a <a href="#implementing-cli-commands">basic command</a>. The framework provides the developers with some of the commonly used helper inputs like asking a question. We will take a look at the available options.</p>
    <h3>Prompt</h3>
    <p>Prompt is used to read any type of user input. The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#getInput"><code>CLICommand::getInput()</code></a> is used to perform that task. The method accepts 3 parameters. The first one is the text that will be shown to the user. The second one is a default value which will be used when the user hit "Enter" without typing anything. The last one is a closure which can be used to validate user input.</p>
    <p>The following code snippit shows how to get user input as prompt.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$userInput = $this->getInput('Give me your name:');
    $this->println("Your name is: $userInput");</code></pre>
    <p>The following code snippit shows how to use default values with prompt in addition to using a validation function. In this case, the default value will be "Orange". </p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$userInput = $this->getInput('Enter a fruit name:', 'Orange', function ($userInput){
        $allowedVals = ['Apple','Orange','Lemon'];
        if (in_array($userInput, $allowedVals) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    });
    $this->println("Fruit name: $userInput");</code></pre>
    <h3>Confirm</h3>
    <p>The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#confirm"><code>CLICommand::confirm()</code></a> is used to ask the user question which can have two answers only, yes or no. The method have two parameters. The first one is the text that will be shown in the console and the second is a boolean that represents default value if the user hit "Enter" without specifying an answer. The method will return true if the answer was "yes" and false if the answer is "no". The default answer will appear in upper case in terminal if specified.</p>
    <p>To submit the answer, the user have to type n for "no" or y for "yes" in the console and hit "Enter". Note that if the user submitted any other answer, the method will keep asking till he submit one of the two answers.</p>
    <p>The following code sample shows how to use this method.</p>
    <pre><code>if ($this->confirm('Are you sure that you would like to continue?')) {
        $this->success('Will continue.');
    } else {
        $this->warning('Will stop here.');
    }</code></pre>
    <p>The following image shows the output of the command when executed.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/cli00.png" alt="Terminal Output" style="height:auto;max-width:100%;border:1px solid;">
    <h3>Multiple Choice</h3>
    <p>A multiple choice input is a way to make the user select one of more than one choice. The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#select"><code>CLICommand::select()</code></a> is used to show the question and the possible choices. The method accepts 3 parameters. The first one is the text that will be shown to the user. The second one is the array that contains the choices at which the user will select from. The last parameter is an optional default value to use in case the user hit "Enter" without selecting any choice. The user can select an answer by supplying its number as an input or the full text of the choice.</p>
    <p>The following code sample shows how to use it by asking a simple question.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$choices = [
        'PHP',
        'JavaScript',
        'C++','HTML',
        'C#'
    ];
    $answer = $this->select('Which of the following is not a programming language?', $choices);

    if ($answer == 'HTML') {
        $this->success('Correct Answer');
    } else {
        $this->error('Wrong answer.');
    }</code></pre>
    <h2>Coloring Output</h2>
    <p>One of the things that programmers like are the colors which appear in any terminal. In addition to making the output looks nice, colors can be used as an indicator for warnings or errors during execution. The framework supports output formatting using colors if the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#println"><code>CLICommand::println()</code></a> or the method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#prints"><code>CLICommand::prints()</code></a>. In addition to that, it is possible to format a string using ANSI escape sequences using the static method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#formatOutput"><code>CLICommand::formatOutput()</code></a>. The way to formate the output will be the same for the 3 methods.</p>
    <p>Formatting output is very simple. The method <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#prints"><code>CLICommand::prints()</code></a> takes two parameters, the first one is the output value and the second one is an associative array of formatting options. If the developer would like to output ANSI formatted text, simply he must supply the second argument. In order to change the color of the output, we must set the value of the index <code>color</code> color to the color that we would like to use.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$this->prints('This is a red text ', [
        'color' => 'red'
    ]);
    $this->prints(', this is blue text ', [
        'color' => 'blue'
    ]);
    $this->prints('and this is green text ', [
        'color' => 'green'
    ]);</code></pre>
    <img src="assets/images/cli02.png" alt="Terminal Output" style="height:auto;max-width:100%;border:1px solid;">
    <p>In addition to changing the color of the output, it is possible to set the background color of the text by adding the index bg-color. Also, the array can have the following text formatting options added as booleans:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>bold</code>: Make output bold.</li>
    <li><code>underline</code>: Make output underlined.</li>
    <li><code>blink</code>: Make the output blink.</li>
    <li><code>reverse</code>: Reverse output colors (make background color become the text color and vice versa).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following code snippits uses the method <code>CLICommand::println()</code> to show the output. </p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">$this->println("Normal Text");

    $this->println("Bold light blue text", [
        'color' => 'light-blue',
        'bold' => true
    ]);

    $this->println("%s", "Underlined with green background.", [
        'bg-color' => 'green',
        'underline' => true
    ]);

    $this->println("%s", "Blinking With Red Background", [
        'bg-color' => 'red',
        'blink' => true
    ]);
    </code></pre>
    <img src='assets/images/cli03.gif' alt="Terminal Output" style="height:auto;max-width:100%;border:1px solid;">
    <h3>Pre-made Methods For Output Formatting</h3>
    <p>The class <a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand"><code>CLICommand</code></a> provides the developer with methods which can be used to display the output formatted without using formatting options. The methods can be used to show output for repeated tasks. The methods are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://webfiori.com/docs/webfiori/entity/cli/CLICommand#error"><code>CLICommand::error()</code></a>: Output a message that represents an error.</li>
